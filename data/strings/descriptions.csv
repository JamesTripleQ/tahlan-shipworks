tahlan_Yukikaze,SHIP,"Part of the Tri-Tachyon Corporations secret ""Project Kaze"", the Yukikaze is a unique blackops cruiser designed to operate in tandem with the smaller Korikaze frigates and autonomously carry out its objectives. While the Tri-Tachyon corporation still denies being responsible for the development and construction of this ship, its appearance being almost exclusively linked to incidents that have been of great benefit to the corporation, few have any doubts about this connection.",,,
tahlan_Korikaze,SHIP,"Designed as a support craft for the Yukikaze, these small drone frigates can be linked with the Yukikaze’s neural network to improve the performance of all linked vessels in combat and allow for complex attack maneuvers that require precise cooperation.",,,
tahlan_Firemane,SHIP,"A modification of the Colossus born from a demand for a cheap platform for heavy weaponry. As the energy demand of these weapons surpasses the flux grid of the Colossus, the shield generator was removed and replaced with additional armour plating. While the Firemane’s combat performance is questionable, it is undeniably a cheaper heavy weapons platform than a Dominator.",,,
tahlan_Castigator,SHIP,"Presumably a precursor design to the modern Eagle, the Castigator was, for its time, an overengineered assault cruiser that never made it into large-scale production due to numerous issues. Not only was it overpriced, but the downscaled TPCs in its forward prongs suffered from reliability issues with their magnetic containment systems. These issues aside, however, the performance of the Castigator is without question impressive. Combining heavy armor, numerous weapon mounts and adequate maneuverability in a heavy cruiser package designed to fight at the frontlines of any battle. Charging into combat with its visually spectacular Assault Burn, the Castigator is an awe-inspiring sight to behold and an enemy most would prefer to avoid facing head-on.",,,
tahlan_Castigator_xiv,SHIP,"When in trials with the Domain Navy, a number of Castigator-class vessels were manufactured to alternate specifications suiting the needs of the various battlegroups' combat doctrines. For the Fourteenth Battlegroup, a variant equipped with a pair of standard TPCs was developed and although it was dismissed by Domain Navy for impracticality due to requiring the sacrifice of two of its medium-sized weapon mounts to make room for the additional hardware and supplementary power generators, it was well-loved by some of the battlegroup's higher-ups. While the variant ultimately never went into production and there are no known surviving ships of the variant, rumours have it that the constructions plans are still out there in the Persean Sector.

tahlan_Castigator_P,SHIP,"An uncommon design to begin with, not many Castigator hulls find their way into the hands of pirates and none of them in proper working order. Lacking the technical ability to restore the ship's signature UTPCs, the crew of this particular hull has opted to rip them out and make room for a large hardpoint while also bypassing the auxiliary thrusters to run them well above safety limits.

tahlan_Bento,SHIP,"Lovingly called ""Lunchbox"" by many a captain for feeding their hungry ship drives, the Bento-class combat tanker is a sturdy little craft that can hold its own in battle. Often found in smaller flotillas that can't spare escorts for their logistics vessels or trade fleets that wish to be better defended against pirate attacks on long-haul routes, the Bento is a solid alternative to the ever-present Dram. While it obviously has to sacrifice fuel capacity, it is often a viable option to simply bring a second Bento.",,,
tahlan_Bento_lp,SHIP,"Fanatics of the Luddic Path have made this ship their own, stripping out all unnecessary furnishing and transforming it into a haphazard vehicle of holy war.

tahlan_Vale,SHIP,"""With holy furor he searches the land for any who would defy the will of his god, bringing carnage and death upon them. He is the holy warrior, guided by his unshakable faith.""",,,
tahlan_Exa_Pico,SHIP,"Rumours say the origin of this unusual craft was a bet between engineers of the Great Houses to turn the Kite into a fearsome combat vessel. True or not, the Exa Pico exists and is indeed a fearsome vessel in its own right. Probably taking inspiration from the Tempest, the Exa Pico heavily relies on its drones to provide the majority of its combat potential while the modified Kite itself serves primarily as control unit. Each drone is equipped with a powerful fractal laser, capable of engaging multiple targets at once and wiping outs whole swarms of missiles and strikecraft. 
Powerful as these capabilities are, however, the ship is still small and quite fragile while also being unable to deploy its drones from range, requiring close proximity to retain control of the advanced hardware.",,,
tahlan_Kodai,SHIP,"Based on the chassis of a reliable mining cruiser, the Kodai was overhauled from ground up for military use. Upgraded with more proper armor plating and modern hybrid weapon mounts, the only relic of its predecessor's role is the nose-mounted mining lance, as it proved to be surprisingly effective in combat. Originally designed to safely maneuver in and survey asteroid fields, the Kodai's chassis still comes equipped with state-of-the-art surveying equipment and a drive assembly that allows for swift movement. The focus on medium hardpoints is another artifact of its origins, once meant to hold a number of mining blasters, it now gives the Kodai menacing frontal firepower while its mobility mitigates risks of being flanked effectively.",,,
tahlan_Ambrosia,SHIP,"An unusual design, the Ambrosia was seemingly constructed around the salvaged hangar module of an unknown carrier design. While its exact origins are unknown, the hangar module is filled to the brim with state-of-the-art technology, including a recall system. Connecting the hangar module to a colorful mixture of salvaged ship parts has allowed it to operate as a standalone ship with surprising effectiveness, even though it is likely that whatever engineers are responsible for the design barely understood even half the technologies hidden inside the module.",,,
tahlan_Castella,SHIP,"An outdated carrier design, the Castella had mostly been replaced by the Legion in fleets of the Domain, but found itself popular with smaller system defense forces or independent fleets. Salvagers in particular took a liking to the antiquated design.",,,
tahlan_Castella_pirates,SHIP,"This rarely seen refit of a Castella-type hull is regarded as a small legend amongst pirates, showing many signs of competent engineering rarely seen amongst these lawless groups. Its most striking feature is a massive spinally-mounted cannon that will strike fear into any poor merchant finding himself in its sights.

An outdated carrier design, the Castella had mostly been replaced by the Legion in fleets of the Domain, but found itself popular with smaller system defense forces or independent fleets. Salvagers in particular took a liking to the antiquated design.",,,
tahlan_Castella_lp,SHIP,"Fanatics of the Luddic Path have made this ship their own, stripping out all unnecessary furnishing and transforming it into a haphazard vehicle of holy war.

Heavily modified by Pathers, this variant of the Castella sacrifices a considerable amount of its hangar space for two additional large hardpoints and an assault burn system which origins can only be guessed at. 

An outdated carrier design, the Castella had mostly been replaced by the Legion in fleets of the Domain, but found itself popular with smaller system defense forces or independent fleets. Salvagers in particular took a liking to the antiquated design.",,,
tahlan_Nessie,SHIP,"What madness drove scavengers to create this abomination of a phase ship remains unknown, but the crude amalgamation of two Gremlins and a Lasher has somehow come out to be a functional design. Presumably meant to emulate the Doom, this makeshift design falls short of that goal in just about every way imaginable. Its makeshift construction renders it remarkably fragile and noticeably limits mobility potential. Truly, the only thing it has going for it is the rather surprising firepower it can muster.",,,
tahlan_Bungalow,SHIP,"An early competitor of the Mora, the Bungalow's designers favoured the idea of maximizing fighter projection capability at the cost of durability. Unremarkable in its design, the ship is essentially little more than a flying hangar and relies on escorts to keep enemies at bay.",,,
tahlan_Ingress,SHIP,"Intended as a successor to the Legion, the Ingress never quite took off with its heavier focus on its fighter complement. Regardless, ships of this type still enjoy a decent popularity with smaller navies for their broad mission profile and overall flexibility.",,,
tahlan_Yosei,SHIP,"A modification of the Tempest, the Yosei is a heavier frigate that sacrifices some mobility for additional firepower.",,,
tahlan_Skola,SHIP,"Small and fast, the Skola is a fast attack frigate built around a pair of prism coils, high-powered arc weapons that can fry ships and missiles alike. While these weapons lack range, the Skola's high mobility is more than capable of compensating for this weakness.",,,
tahlan_Haelequin,SHIP,"An aggressive frame combined with a temporal shell, the Haelequin is a frightening opponent to face. While the design's origins are unknown, it is assumed to be a discarded Tri-Tachyon prototype design that was later picked up and finished by an unknown Kassadari House.",,,
tahlan_Izanami,SHIP,"The final ship design created by Kassadari shipwrights before the collapse, the Izanami is the pinnacle of Kassadari engineering. Constructed around a fully-integrated 6th generation Temporal Circuit Grid it is the only ship of its kind as the majority of engineers involved in the project lost their life during the chaos that followed the collapse, leaving the Houses with only a partial understanding of the Izanami's inner workings.

Few of these ships were ever produced as its blueprints are likely lost to time and Kassadar's production capacity is only a faint shadow of its former self. The remaining operable vessels are a closely guarded treasure of the Houses, only deployed if of utmost necessity.

While outwardly only a light cruiser, the advanced temporal technology of the Izanami makes it punch far above its weight class, capable of taking on any other cruiser in the sector. Any captain capable of efficiently making use of its ability to almost stop time for a short duration will find the ship capable of unleashing terrifying barrages and dodging almost any kind of incoming fire. This power comes at a cost however, as the high-powered temporal field puts heavy strain on the ship's spaceframe, making it more susceptible to damage while active. Careless use of the system is a surefire way to an early grave.",,,
tahlan_Renki,SHIP,"A dedicated missile and support frigate, equipped with an active ECCM system that can provide ECCM benefits for nearby allies while active. Especially popular with missile-heavy fleets, the Renki is a workhorse frigate, that can also pack a punch by itself.",,,
tahlan_Timeless,SHIP,An unusual drone ship of unknown design and origins.,,,
tahlan_Timeless_retro,SHIP,"Based on a blueprint found in a hidden data vault, this unusual design appears to be a prototype for a drone mothership. While not capable of the same feats as the finished design, due to having to sacrifice hangar space and armor plating for crew space, it is still an impressive piece of technology.",,,
tahlan_Nameless,SHIP,An unusual drone ship of unknown design and origins.,,,
tahlan_Fragmenta,SHIP,An unusual drone fighter deployed in swarms by larger drone ships.,,,
tahlan_Defiance,SHIP,"Designed after the collapse using parts of existing ship designs, the Defiance was meant to be a cheaper alternative to the Gryphon for a decent missile cruiser. While the resulting ship doesn't quite achieve the same level of missile firepower, it makes up for it with more ballistic mounts.",,,
tahlan_Torii,SHIP,"A small destroyer designed purely for the purpose of pointing as many guns at the enemy as possible on a lightweight platform. It may achieve this goal quite well, but the extremely wide profile makes the ship quite fragile and easy to hit.",,,
tahlan_Eagle_P,SHIP,"This Eagle has been enthusiastically ""upgraded"" by a merry band of pirates with larger weapons mounts and a fighter bay. Concerns about the lack of point defense mounts have been happily ignored since ""the fighters can deal with that crap"".

Eagle-class cruisers are often found at the core of military fleets headed for battle. It is not hard to see why: A strong overall profile, with a robust engine, the Eagle's deadly weapons package is a threat to all enemies.

The Eagle can deliver a strong tactical punch to enemy formations. Its numerous turret and hardpoint emplacements make it very dangerous to smaller foes. Decent armor and a strong shield emitter let it hold space while outnumbered, or even when faced with the rare larger ship. 

These strengths are somewhat countered by strike craft - an Eagle captain must always watch their scopes for an approaching strike squadron, since their ship will be easily crippled by multiple hits from modern strike weapons. 

The embodiment of the sleek and powerful space cruiser from the time of the Domain, the Eagle-class ships are a beautiful reminder of the technological and aesthetic achievements of humanity's past. ",,,
tahlan_Tempest_P,SHIP,"Rarely found in the hands of pirates, the Tempest is popular with those who do manage to come into possession of one. This particular example has been ""enhanced"" in proper pirate fashion, enabling it to mount some ballistic weaponry and replacing its engine block with a bigger, albeit not necessarily better, one.

An asymmetric, advanced design from the late Expansion Epoch, the Tempest-class is the quintessential attack frigate - fast, deadly and difficult to destroy.",,,
tahlan_Dominator_PH,SHIP,"While pirates are known to be quite fond of aftermarket modifications for their ships, the fewest are as ambitious as whatever deranged mind had the idea and abilitiy to transplant a set of salvaged phase coils into a Dominator hull and hook them up to a comically oversized power core. The result can only be described as an absurdity, possessing unusual agility while phased with the firepower and armor one would expect of a dominator while unphased. What effects this overtuned phase field must have on the mental stability of the ship's crew can only be guessed, but it is unlikely that whoever willingly signs on to a ship such as this is already past rational thought and common sense.

Ponderous and menacing, the Dominator-class is one of the most widespread system defense cruisers in Hegemony space. 

While not the most technologically advanced hull, it relies on a plethora of ballistic hardpoints to accomplish its mission, which is more often than not defending orbital installations and vital points of intra-system trade routes. A poor shield emitter which is difficult to manage and thus, rarely engaged, gives way to an almost impregnable interlocking armor belt system making the Dominator safe from most weapons. Even strike craft cannot overcome the hail of projectiles that can be launched to intercept their payloads. This hull proves that tried and true military engineering is difficult to overcome by new ideas and technologies, especially when in the hands of tough, determined crews and experienced officers.

Dependable, durable, and a constant presence in home space around civilized worlds and outposts, the Dominator is perhaps most hated and feared by pirates and law-breaking corporate agents. ",,,
tahlan_Castigator_commie,SHIP,"An extremely unusual variant of the Castigator, this model has been converted into a dedicated carrier, replacing most of its weapon hardpoints with launch decks and hangar space. Surprisingly effective, but suffers from slower fighter maintenance due to the cramped nature of the improvised hangars.

Presumably a precursor design to the modern Eagle, the Castigator was, for its time, an overengineered assault cruiser that never made it into large-scale production due to numerous issues. Not only was it overpriced, but the downscaled TPCs in its forward prongs suffered from reliability issues with their magnetic containment systems. These issues aside, however, the performance of the Castigator is without question impressive. Combining heavy armor, numerous weapon mounts and adequate maneuverability in a heavy cruiser package designed to fight at the frontlines of any battle. Charging into combat with its visually spectacular Assault Burn, the Castigator is an awe-inspiring sight to behold and an enemy most would prefer to avoid facing head-on.",,,
tahlan_Castigator_NC,SHIP,"A unique, heavily upgraded variant of the Castigator of unknown origin. Retrofitted with what appears to be Remnant technology and controlled by a single pilot, neurally linked to the ship's systems.

tahlan_DunScaith,SHIP,"Constructed around the carcass of an Onslaught-class battleship, the Dun Scaith is a colossal warmachine like it could only have been conceived by the minds behind the Legio Infernalis. Clad in heavy armour and covered in weapons, this massive dreadnought is an imposing sight to behold and the nightmare of any patrol commander in civilized space. Where it goes, destruction follows and few have survived an encounter with this beast.

While the exact specifications of the design are unknown, it is clear that it follows no strict blueprint and individual examples of this class are constructed with whatever parts are available to create the closest possible approximation of the intended design. Their total number is unknown, although it can't be very high, given the extensive difficulty of even procuring the necessary salvage without directly preying upon Hegemony patrol fleets.

Rare sources from within the Legio Infernalis imply that the Dun Scaith class is to be the vanguard of a new battlefleet, by which the persean sector is to one day be subjugated and brought under the heels of its self-proclaimed rightful owners.",,,
tahlan_DunScaith_gh,SHIP,"Exactly how a Dun Scaith class dreadnought has made its way into the hands of Kassadari Engineers remains a mystery, but their work on this terrifying vessel is what seems truly unbelievable. Having fully reconstructed major sections of the ship and adding the typical Kassadari upgrades, the ship has been transformed from a powerful dreadnought into a warmachine the likes of which were once only wielded by the best of the domain navy legions.",,,
tahlan_Hresvelgr,SHIP,"Preceding the adoption of the Legion as mainstay battlecarrier, the Hresvelgr saw fairly widespread use in the domain navy, owing to its excellent fighter capacity. The design fell out of favour over the years, however, as Domain battlegroups that favoured fleet carriers began adopting the Astral for its superior striking power.

Not many of these ships were present in the Persean Sector at the time of the collapse, but they have come back into use by various navies due to their lower production requirements and ability to project large and reliable fighter screens that had proven invaluable during the AI wars.",,,
tahlan_Hresvelgr_p,SHIP,"Modified by pirates to give it more striking power, this unusual variant of the Hresvelgr comes with a greatly increased capacity for missile weaponry at the cost of its ballistic potential and fighter reserves. While highly dangerous, the underlying hull design remains on the fragile end for capital ships.

Preceding the adoption of the Legion as mainstay battlecarrier, the Hresvelgr saw fairly widespread use in the domain navy, owing to its excellent fighter capacity.

tahlan_Glint,SHIP,"The Yari is what some would classify as a showpiece, supposedly designed as a weapons demonstration platform for executives. With a sleek hull and luxurious interior, it is more akin to a private yacht than a purpose-built warship. While originally not intended for general production, the design found some popularity with private security forces and independent fleets for both its design and impressive dual large energy mounts, which brought it on the general market.",,,
tahlan_Bronco,SHIP,"Originally designed as a light freighter, the Bronco saw little commercial success in its intended configuration. Pirates however commonly repurposed the ship into a missile destroyer and thus inspired a proper redesign of the hull, replacing its cargo bays with large missile storage units linked to a pair of nose-mounted missile hardpoints. A singular medium ballistic mounts for self-defense was also added and outfitted with a state-of-the-art ammo feeder system to give it some additional punch when forced into close quarters combat.",,,
tahlan_Bronco_p,SHIP,"In an ironic twist of fate, this Bronco has been refitted once again by pirates. Ever the clear thinkers, these pirates took note of the excellent ammo feeder system and thusly converted the nose missile hardpoints into another pair of ballistic mounts to take full advantage. Not wanting to let the large missile storage space go to waste, they also modified the intended forward point defense turret mounts to accept missiles instead and finished off the conversion with some souped-up thrusters as they are ever so popular with the unlawful masses.

tahlan_Nibelung,SHIP,"An ancient design, the Nibelung-class battleship predates even the venerable Onslaught and harkens back to a different school of ship design. Built around a powerful broadside to be employed as part of a massive battle line, the Nibelung fell out of favor with a shift in Domain military doctrine.

While the design predates the age of modular weaponry and shields, its turret-focused design proved well-suited for the adaption of modular weapon mounts and a number of major refits kept the ship relevant for a great many years in planetary defense or paramilitary forces.",,,
tahlan_Nibelung_n,SHIP,"A true rarity in the current day and age, this particular Nibelung must be centuries old, still carrying its original integrated main battery cannons. Having been only partially refitted to allow for the installation of modular weaponry on the secondary weapon emplacements, the refit is clearly a custom job performed by an individual who prized the massive singularity warhead batteries.

tahlan_Phoca,SHIP,"The Phoca is a light cruiser that heavily focuses on a powerful ballistic broadside equipped with advanced ammo feeders. While fielding impressive firepower, the ship itself is quite fragile and relies on hit-and-run fly-by maneuvers to stay alive while dealing its damage.",,,
tahlan_Ristreza,SHIP,"A rare example of Kassadari pre-collapse ship design, the Ristreza dates back to the early development of the Great Houses' signature temporal circuit grid technology. Equipped with the first fully operational grid and a number of other prototype designs, she served as the testbed for numerous Kassadari technologies over her lifetime. The exact number of vessels of this type ever constructed remains a mystery, but it is known that they once formed the backbone of the Kassadari fleet prior to the adoption of their refit doctrine in the wake of the collapse.

While originally intended as an experimental vessel, the Ristreza is a highly capable warship in her own right and was operated as such for a large portion of her service history.",,,
tahlan_Cuchulainn,SHIP,"The Cuchulainn is an experimental craft built around a massively upscaled tachyon beam weapon. Originally intended as a potential siege weapon for engaging stations and orbital bombardment, the final prototype never produced the expected results and the project was abandoned. The remaining prototypes have since found their way into the hands of various collectors around the sector.",,,

#fighters,,,,,
tahlan_Acastus,SHIP,A fast interceptor armed with a pair of impactor guns. Possesses impressive striking power against shielded targets.,,,
tahlan_Caliver,SHIP,"Designed for the sole purpose of delivering a single Hekaton-class torpedo within strike distance, the Caliver is a relatively simple design by Kassadari standards. Of course, calling a fighter with integrated temporal circuit grid simple might be seen as a bit of an understatement by some.",,,
tahlan_Exec_M,SHIP,A highly advanced drone equipped with a multi-beam emitter capable of targeting multiple incoming threats at once.,,,
tahlan_Dikaiosyne,SHIP,"A unique point-defense drone, presumably based on a Kassadari design. Features a multi-beam emitter and temporal circuits.",,,
tahlan_Valacor,SHIP,"An unusual heavy fighter of Kassadri design, equipped with a pair of large underslung ion pulse weapons. Their sturdiness makes them excellent harrassers that can maintain pressure and severely impact a target's combat capability.",,,
tahlan_Scoralis,SHIP,"A superheavy bomber of Kassadari design, carrying a massive payload of 4 guided torpedos based on the Hekaton. Their high-explosive warhead has been downscaled to accomodate guidance systems. While the Scoralis carries some truly impressive firepower, the fighter itself is fairly slow and a large target, requiring escorts to reliably deliver its payload. To increase chances after survival, a set of afterburners kick in once the torpedo ordnance has been depleted, granting the bomber increased mobility for its return flight.",,,

tahlan_monitor_gh,SHIP,"Heavily modified and overhauled by Kassadari engineers, this ship has been upgraded with the most advanced technologies of the Great Houses.

An oddity among ships, the Monitor is the result of the line of thought that “sometimes the best defense is indeed the best defense”. Features turret mounts angled to provide wide arcs and a unique “flux shunt” modification to its power systems specially constructed to relieve flux generated by shields. Indeed, the Monitor makes up for a lack of maneuverability and firepower with the ability to withstand prolonged bombardment from enemy ordnance.

Though its experimental nature is perhaps a sign of the innovation that eras of turmoil seem to inspire, whether the Monitor’s radical defensive focus is a boon or pitfall remains contentious. Several dramatic failures in convoy protection patrols were explained by Ko Combine PR representatives to be the fault of improper tactics employed by convoy commanders. Ko Combine maintains that when positioned correctly in a combat situation and supported by strikecraft - as the anvil and hammer, respectively - simulations demonstrate that the Monitor significantly enhances convoy survivability against the average pirate attack. Prominent critics remain.",,,
tahlan_legion_gh,SHIP,"Heavily modified and overhauled by Kassadari engineers, this ship has been upgraded with the most advanced technologies of the Great Houses.

Classified as a battlecarrier, the Legion mounts an impressive array of heavy weapons, hangar-space, and command-control sufficient to field four fighter wings. Later models were upgraded with nanoforges keyed to replacement of fightercraft, significantly increasing tooth-to-tail ratio on distant deployments.

After the legendary success of the Onslaught design it became clear that rebellious systems without ultraheavy industry were able to develop carrier-based strike-craft capable of countering the 'Old Man' of the Armada. Alongside new weapons - nimble anti-fighter missiles and rapid-tracking point defense cannon - the Strategic Council decided to deploy a carrier worthy of service alongside the Onslaught. Thus the Legion was designed to provide a platform for interceptors and strike-craft while standing on the line of battle. 

Proponents of the 'Cruiser School' criticized the Legion for insufficient specialization, maintaining that similar fighter volume can be fielded at less cost and greater flexibility if combat roles are separated into distinct ship hulls. These economic arguments do pale in the face of an incoming Legion engaging its burn drive to deliver crushing firepower at the key point of battle.",,,
tahlan_onslaught_gh,SHIP,"Heavily modified and overhauled by Kassadari engineers, this ship has been upgraded with the most advanced technologies of the Great Houses.

A venerable design, the Onslaught-class battleships were first created to serve the Domain Armada long ago, before the development of advanced strike weapons, modern energy weapons, and shield systems. 

When first launched from orbital dock, they must have surely dwarfed any other ship in existence and intimidated entire systems. Some even say that they were built to combat non-humans in a long forgotten war. Much later, Domain engineers made modifications to the blueprints to include a shield system, upgraded the FTL drives, and reduced the necessary crew complement through automation and iterative engineering. Even though more advanced blueprints are available, the Onslaught remains the easiest to manufacture due to the brutal simplicity of its systems. 

A ship designed without shields in mind, built to be able to withstand a heavy barrage of enemy fire and strike back while protecting its crew is much loved by its officers and crew. And strike back it can; the Onslaught's unmatched ballistic potential can devastate entire fleets in minutes, its only drawback a logistical dependency on ammunition. 

The Onslaught-class proudly serves as the backbone of the Hegemony Navy.",,,
tahlan_vendetta_gh,SHIP,"Heavily modified and overhauled by Kassadari engineers, this ship has been upgraded with the most advanced technologies of the Great Houses.

A dated but imposing battleship with a storied service history, the Vendetta is the Yang to the mighty Onslaught's Yin. While the Onslaught plays the part of blunt, chaotic sledgehammer, the Vendetta is a more precise “wedge” of a ship; steadier, more agile, and capable of concentrated bursts of fire with an ordnance package that favors capital-grade missile and torpedo weaponry.

Like its sibling battleship, the first production models of the Vendetta lacked shield generators, relying on their thick armor and arsenal of turreted weaponry for defense against attackers. Later versions of the hull were modernized and featured a mid-grade Omni shield, though unlike the Onslaught this would require a slight reduction in its armor package. Nonetheless, the Vendetta remains a highly durable ship. What it lacks in bezerker speed and raw firepower it makes up for with improved capacity for situational weapons systems and a potential tactical punch that an Onslaught could simply never match.",,,

tahlan_enforcer_gh,SHIP,"Heavily modified and overhauled by Kassadari engineers, this ship has been upgraded with the most advanced technologies of the Great Houses.

The Enforcer-class ships commonly serve in system or convoy defense roles. The design features good armor and multiple ballistic hardpoints, while shield performance is somewhat underwhelming. 

The blueprints of the ship call for many components similar to those found in the Onslaught-class battleships, suggesting that the designs were created during a similar period of military expansion in the Domain. The Enforcer-class features similar no-nonsense weapon system design choices, tough bulkheads, and is well regarded by its crews.

Tough to beat in a destroyer to destroyer fight, the Enforcer rarely takes part in larger battles due to the common view that its low speed makes it a liability. Nonetheless, Hegemony order of battle doctrines mandate an attached Enforcer squadron as a screen for Onslaught-class battleships. The logistical ease with which shared components can be used by both ship types is exactly the type of detail that excites Hegemony Logisticarum bureaucrats.",,,
tahlan_Castigator_knight,SHIP,"Heavily modified and overhauled by Kassadari engineers, this ship has been upgraded with the most advanced technologies of the Great Houses.

Presumably a precursor design to the modern Eagle, the Castigator was, for its time, an overengineered assault cruiser that never made it into large-scale production due to numerous issues. Not only was it overpriced, but the downscaled TPCs in its forward prongs suffered from reliability issues with their magnetic containment systems. These issues aside, however, the performance of the Castigator is without question impressive. Combining heavy armor, numerous weapon mounts and adequate maneuverability in a heavy cruiser package designed to fight at the frontlines of any battle. Charging into combat with its visually spectacular Assault Burn, the Castigator is an awe-inspiring sight to behold and an enemy most would prefer to avoid facing head-on.",,,

# Weapons,,,,,
,,,,,
tahlan_shiva,WEAPON,"A prototype pulse beam developed for the Yukikaze. Incredibly efficient and destructive for a beam weapon, it suffers from extreme beam dispersal at range, limiting it to extremely short range engagements.",Assault,,
tahlan_garuda,WEAPON,A prototype seeking pulse weapon developed for the Yukikaze. Fully integrated into the Yukikaze this odd weapon fires high energy plasma blasts that are then guided using EM-fields projected by the ship. The result is a unique energy weapon with missile-like properties.,Strike,,
tahlan_jigoku,WEAPON,"Replacing the Thermal Pulse Cannons, this beam weapon was adapted from salvaged stricture-type pulse beams, but remodulated to be equally efficient against shields and armour and fed by an oversized capacitor array capable of storing multiple charges, ready to be fired in quick succession.",Strike,,
tahlan_utpc,WEAPON,"A downscaled version of the Thermal Pulse Cannon, this unique weapon is notorious for its unreliability. While technically a defective design, many gunnery officers familiar with the weapon regard its tempramental nature as a feature rather than a flaw. Often discharging additional splinter bolts with each shot, the weapon's output will often exceed its intended firepower by vast amounts, albeit in a chaotic nature.",,,
tahlan_utpc_l,WEAPON,"Surely driven by some kind of madness, scientists of Kassadar have adapted the design of the Castigator's UTPC back to a modified Onslaught blueprint, scaling the weapon back to full size, but retaining its unstable nature for a truly absurd weapon. Often discharging additional splinter bolts with each shot, the weapon's output will often exceed its intended firepower by vast amounts, albeit in a chaotic nature.",,,
tahlan_magaera,WEAPON,"In essence little more than a pair of twin-linked Gallant-type magnetic accelerator cannons with extended barrels, the Magaera improves on the range and firepower of its smaller sibling.",,,
tahlan_gallant,WEAPON,"Technically a fairly standard magnetic accelerator cannon, the Gallant is however a technological showpiece. Equipped with a miniaturized Temporal Circuit, the entire charging and firing mechanism is put under constant time acceleration, boosting the weapon's cycle rate compared to similar weapons.",,,
tahlan_porph,WEAPON,A heavy cannon firing plasma igniter shells that are effective against virtually any target.,,,
tahlan_volkite,WEAPON,"The preferred point-defense solution of the Great Houses, this magazine-fed dual cannon fires highly effective voidburst rounds.",,,
tahlan_dualvolkite,WEAPON,"Effectively just a pair of Volkites linked together, the Volkite Battery excels at saturating an area with voidburst rounds, shredding just about any missiles attempting to pass through.",,,
tahlan_hekaton,WEAPON,"Designed as a more refined alternative to the more brutish torpedos commonly used in the sector, this Kassadari design carries a dual stage warhead, supplementing its explosive power with a plasma burst discharge.",,,
tahlan_hekaton_rack,WEAPON,"Designed as a more refined alternative to the more brutish torpedos commonly used in the sector, this Kassadari design carries a dual stage warhead, supplementing its explosive power with a plasma burst discharge.",,,
tahlan_hekaton_fighter,WEAPON,"Designed as a more refined alternative to the more brutish torpedos commonly used in the sector, this Kassadari design carries a dual stage warhead, supplementing its explosive power with a plasma burst discharge.",,,
tahlan_styrix,WEAPON,"A weapon often described as relentless, this heavy magnetic accelerator cannon fires at a rate uncommon for weapons of its type. Designed to unleash a constant barrage of high-velocity impactor rounds to maintain heavy pressure. The impactor rounds are also loaded with a micro warhead that can cause additional damage if the round manages to pierce the outer layers of armor.",,,
tahlan_atrapos,WEAPON,A medium railcannon firing an armor-piercing dual warhead projectile featuring an experimental temporal fragmentation warhead.,,,
tahlan_armiger,WEAPON,"Reliable and effective, the Armiger is a medium-caliber cannon that prioritizes projectile velocity and range over sheer firepower, making for a weapon that pairs well with high-velocity kinetic armaments.",,,
tahlan_prismcoil,WEAPON,"An integrated arc-discharge weapon, rapidly discharging bolts of energy to any enemies within its targeting cone. Effective against all targets, it can also function as a point-defense weapon.",,,
tahlan_astrix,WEAPON,A twin-linked heavy cannon with good striking power. Its secondary plasma burst warhead grants it slightly improved performance against shields.,,,
tahlan_teltrite,WEAPON,"Designed to supplement Volkite-type PD weapons against harder targets, this micro-railgun fires hypervelocity kinetic slugs to intercept incoming missiles and strikecraft. Being particularly effective against shielded fighters, it truly shines when paired with Volkite-class PD solutions as intended.",,,
tahlan_fusor,WEAPON,"Originally designed for shipbreaking operations, these industrial fusion torches have found great popularity amongst pirates for their destructive potential when sufficiently modified. While their range is severely limited, the damage potential and electromagnetic interference of the bluehot flame makes it a terrifying weapon on fast attack ships.",,,
tahlan_mininglance,WEAPON,"Designed for mining operations, this lance was never intended for combat use, but is no less effective at cutting apart spaceships than any other high-powered directed energy beam.",,,
tahlan_disparax,WEAPON,"A heavy plasma cannon of unknown origin. Boasting solid firepower and fast projectiles, it has a strong general purpose profile.",,,
tahlan_relparax,WEAPON,A medium energy blaster of unknown origin. A versatile and flexible weapon that is effective against most targets.,,,
tahlan_nenparax,WEAPON,"A small energy beam emitter of unknown origin. Fires a powerful and high-impact beam that is highly effective against small targets. While potent as a PD weapon, it lacks the internal targeting systems to act as a PD weapon without an external PD system.",,,
tahlan_eradicator,WEAPON,"An icon of pirate hubris, the Eradicator is a heavily modified asteroid mining laser, supercharged to dangerous levels and about as likely to blow out the flux grid of whatever ship it is mounted on with a feedback spike as it is to cut its prey apart. When it functions, however, it does so quite well and to devastating effect.",,,
tahlan_fray,WEAPON,"Based on the hellbore, this upscaled heavy cannon is fully integrated into the ship's hull and outfitted with numerous recoil stabilizers to prevent it from ripping the ship apart when firing. Despite the major upscaling, its actual performance isn't that much superior to a standard hellbore, but the psychological impact of such a massive weapon pointing at a lightly-armored freighter is exceedingly useful in piracy actions.",,,
tahlan_pendragon,WEAPON,"Designed for long-range engagements, the Pendragon is a unique MIRV launcher that utilizes a fast but barely maneuverable carrier missile to deliver a swarm of agile micromissiles into effective range.",,,
tahlan_efreet,WEAPON,"A somewhat outdated design, the Efreet fires a constant barrage of kinetic impact shells over long ranges. While generally effective, the simple design lacks adequate recoil compensation for its massive propelling charge and suffers from subpar projectile velocity and bad accuracy during extended firing.",,,
tahlan_titanomachy,WEAPON,"Going back to an antiquated design, this unique beam weapon uses a synthetic crystal as focus for a powerful sustained directed energy beam. While powerful in and of itself, the weapon can operate at an increased powerlevel when the mounting ship's flux grid is under heavy load, presumably due to the unique properties of its focus crystal.",,,
tahlan_tpc_s,WEAPON,"A bulky energy weapon from an early epoch, the TPC is built directly into the Castigator's hull and provides overwhelming frontal firepower.

Designed before modular energy weapons were universally trusted by Domain naval architects, this weapon was coded into the Onslaught's blueprint because no other hull of the time was large enough or had reactors capable of generating the requisite power.

This particular variant was later adapted to the Castigator chassis and while it possesses the same firepower as those used on an Onslaught, the more limited power supply of the smaller Castigator limits its charge capacity.",Assault,,
tahlan_gardas,WEAPON,"Like many Kassadari weapons, the Gardas is a design never truly intended for mass production. A heavily overengineered railcannon firing an armor-piercing round with a temporal fragmentation warhead, this massive weapon is highly effective against armor and causality itself, but lacks the technological refinement of a mainline combat weapon.
",,,
tahlan_dragonslayer,WEAPON,An integrated torpedo tube for hammer-class torpedos. Equipped with an autoloader for extended engagements.,,,
tahlan_fafnir,WEAPON,"A massive artillery cannon predating the era of modular weaponry, the Fafnir was designed specifically for the Nibelung-class and is an early ancestor of the Mjolnir. The weapon fires a long-range shell with a singularity warhead that is effective against all targets and the fully integrated nature of the weapon makes it more flux-efficient than the contemporary Mjolnir. Few of these weapons can still be found as the majority of remaining Nibelung-class battleships have since been refitted to accomodate modular weaponry, yet a few captains out there held on to these mighty weapons.",,,
tahlan_nuboko_l,WEAPON,An integrated missile battery firing 5 agile multi-purpose missiles for use against most targets.,,,
tahlan_nuboko_r,WEAPON,An integrated missile battery firing 5 agile multi-purpose missiles for use against most targets.,,,
tahlan_volkite_s,WEAPON,Fighter-grade Volkite variant,,,
tahlan_valdes_r,WEAPON,Hypercharged ion blaster mounted on the Valacor. The high rate of fire makes it an excellent suppression weapon.,,,
tahlan_heraton,WEAPON,"A modification of the Hekaton-class torpedo. The primary high-explosive warhead has been downscaled to accomodate guidance systems and the required thrusters. The resulting weapon still packs a punch, but sacrifices speed and damage for improved accuracy.",,,
tahlan_ronka,WEAPON,"A versatile twin cannon firing voidburst charges. Effective against most targets and capable of substituting as point-defense weapon, the Ronka is a true allrounder, but fails to excel at any particular role.",,,
tahlan_anumis,WEAPON,"A pair of superheavy cannons in a twin mount, the Anumis fires accurate high-explosive rounds equipped with a miniaturized version of the Hekaton's signature secondary plasma burst warhead, granting it slightly improved performance against shields.",,,
tahlan_ramun,WEAPON,"A light anti-armor weapon with extended range thanks to an advanced trajectory correction system. Sadly this system comes at the cost of projectile velocity, limiting the weapon's effectiveness against more nimble targets.",,,
tahlan_gleipnir,WEAPON,"A massive spinal hyperrail cannon that served as an early prototype for what is now the Gardas. Unlike the later modular production versions, the Gleipnir is equipped with two capacitor banks and can fire both kinetic impactor rounds and high-explosive fracture warheads, allowing for a devastating double-tap with a shield-breaking shot followed by an armor-breaker. The weapon however suffers from a high power demand, requiring the ship's assault mode to be fully active in order to fire.",,,
tahlan_karion,WEAPON,An advanced suppression weapon firing drone-guided ionizing charges. Due to the small scale of the drones their ammo supply is virtually unlimited. This heavier variant is unique to the Ristreza and boasts improved range and energy damage over modular variants.,,,
tahlan_gaebolg,WEAPON,"The core of the Cuchulainn is a massive tachyon beam projector with impressive output, but suffering from a difficult to maintain design.",,,
tahlan_karionbat,WEAPON,An advanced suppression weapon firing drone-guided ionizing charges. Due to the small scale of the drones their ammo supply is virtually unlimited.,,,
tahlan_gleipnir_s,WEAPON,"While generally identical to the Gleipnir found on a standard Ristrezia, this model had its secondary capacitor bank and alternate ammunition storage units removed to make room for the two Fountainfall arrays. It now serves primarily as anti-shield weapon to supplement the heavy missile barrages.",,,
tahlan_fountainfall_r,WEAPON,"One of two massive VLS missile arrays built into this variant of the Ristreza, capable of saturating large sections of battlespace with micromissiles.",,,
tahlan_fountainfall_l,WEAPON,"One of two massive VLS missile arrays built into this variant of the Ristreza, capable of saturating large sections of battlespace with micromissiles.",,,
tahlan_fountain,WEAPON,"A large pair of micromissile batteries, designed to overwhelm point-defense systems through sheer volume. White the individual missiles aren't exceptionally powerful against larger vessels, they pose a deadly threat to smaller targets.",,,
tahlan_fount,WEAPON,A medium-sized micromissile battery. Quite effective at saturating point-defense systems for a weapon of its size and deadly to smaller ships.,,,
tahlan_xs_beamer,WEAPON,An integrated PD solution mounted just above the Fountainfall arrays to compensate for the lack of standard small mounts.,,,
tahlan_hekaton_repeater,WEAPON,A large launcher for Hekaton-class torpedos. Features a fast reloading mechanism to allow for the firing of torpedos in rapid succession and ample ammunition capacity.,,,
