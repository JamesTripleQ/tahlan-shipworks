# Ships,,,,,
,,,,,
tahlan_Yukikaze,SHIP,"Part of the Tri-Tachyon Corporations secret ""Project Kaze"", the Yukikaze is a unique blackops cruiser designed to operate in tandem with the smaller Korikaze frigates and autonomously carry out its objectives. While the Tri-Tachyon corporation still denies being responsible for the development and construction of this ship, its appearance being almost exclusively linked to incidents that have been of great benefit to the corporation, few have any doubts about this connection.",,,
tahlan_Korikaze,SHIP,"Designed as a support craft for the Yukikaze, these small drone frigates can be linked with the Yukikaze’s neural network to improve the performance of all linked vessels in combat and allow for complex attack maneuvers that require precise cooperation.",,,
tahlan_Firemane,SHIP,"A modification of the Colossus born from a demand for a cheap platform for heavy weaponry. As the energy demand of these weapons surpasses the flux grid of the Colossus, the shield generator was removed and replaced with additional armour plating. While the Firemane’s combat performance is questionable, it is undeniably a cheaper heavy weapons platform than a Dominator.",,,
tahlan_Castigator,SHIP,"Presumably a precursor design to the modern Eagle, the Castigator was, for its time, an overengineered assault cruiser that never made it into large-scale production due to numerous issues. Not only was it overpriced, but the downscaled TPCs in its forward prongs suffered from reliability issues with their magnetic containment systems. These issues aside, however, the performance of the Castigator is without question impressive. Combining heavy armor, numerous weapon mounts and adequate maneuverability in a heavy cruiser package designed to fight at the frontlines of any battle. Charging into combat with its visually spectacular Assault Burn, the Castigator is an awe-inspiring sight to behold and an enemy most would prefer to avoid facing head-on.",,,
tahlan_Bento,SHIP,"Lovingly called ""Lunchbox"" by many a captain for feeding their hungry ship drives, the Bento-class combat tanker is a sturdy little craft that can hold its own in battle. Often found in smaller flotillas that can't spare escorts for their logistics vessels or trade fleets that wish to be better defended against pirate attacks on long-haul routes, the Bento is a solid alternative to the ever-present Dram. While it obviously has to sacrifice fuel capacity, it is often a viable option to simply bring a second Bento.",,,
tahlan_Vale,SHIP,"""With holy furor he searches the land for any who would defy the will of his god, bringing carnage and death upon them. He is the holy warrior, guided by his unshakable faith.""",,,
tahlan_Exa_Pico,SHIP,"Rumours say the origin of this unusual craft was a bet between engineers of the Great Houses to turn the Kite into a fearsome combat vessel. True or not, the Exa Pico exists and is indeed a fearsome vessel in its own right. Probably taking inspiration from the Tempest, the Exa Pico heavily relies on its drones to provide the majority of its combat potential while the modified Kite itself serves primarily as control unit. Each drone is equipped with a powerful fractal laser, capable of engaging multiple targets at once and wiping outs whole swarms of missiles and strikecraft. 
Powerful as these capabilities are, however, the ship is still small and quite fragile while also being unable to deploy its drones from range, requiring close proximity to retain control of the advanced hardware.",,,
tahlan_Kodai,SHIP,"Based on the chassis of a reliable mining cruiser, the Kodai was overhauled from ground up for military use. Upgraded with with proper armor plating and modern hybrid weapon mounts, the only relic of its predecessor's role is the nose-mounted mining lance, as it proved to be surprisingly effective in combat. Originally designed to safely maneuver in and survey asteroid fields, the Kodai's chassis still comes equipped with state-of-the-art surveying equipment and a drive assembly that allows for swift movement. The focus on medium hardpoints is another artifact of its origins, once meant to hold a number of mining blasters, it now gives the Kodai menacing frontal firepower while its mobility mitigates risks of being flanked effectively.",,,
tahlan_Ambrosia,SHIP,"An unusual design, the Ambrosia was seemingly constructed around the salvaged hangar module of an unknown carrier design. While its exact origins are unknown, the hangar module is filled to the brim with state-of-the-art technology, including a recall system. Connecting the hangar module to a colorful mixture of salvaged ship parts has allowed it to operate as a standalone ship with surprising effectiveness, even though it is likely that whatever engineers are responsible for the design barely understood even half the technologies hidden inside the module.",,,
tahlan_Castella,SHIP,"An outdated carrier design, the Castella had mostly been replaced by the Legion in fleets of the Domain, but found itself popular with smaller system defense forces or independent fleets. Salvagers in particular took a liking to the antiquated design.",,,
tahlan_Castella_lp,SHIP,"Fanatics of the Luddic Path have made this ship their own, stripping out all unnecessary furnishing and transforming it into a haphazard vehicle of holy war.

Heavily modified by Pathers, this variant of the Castella sacrifices a considerable amount of its hangar space for two additional large hardpoints and an assault burn system which origins can only be guessed at. 

An outdated carrier design, the Castella had mostly been replaced by the Legion in fleets of the Domain, but found itself popular with smaller system defense forces or independent fleets. Salvagers in particular took a liking to the antiquated design.",,,
tahlan_Nessie,SHIP,"What madness drove scavengers to create this abomination of a phase ship remains unknown, but the crude amalgamation of two Gremlins and a Lasher has somehow come out to be a functional design. Presumably meant to emulate the Doom, this makeshift design falls short of that goal in just about every way imaginable. Its makeshift construction renders it remarkably fragile and noticably limits mobility potential. Truly, the only thing it has going for it is the rather surprising firepower it can muster.",,,
tahlan_Bungalow,SHIP,"An early competitor of the Mora, the Bungalow's designers favoured the idea of maximizing fighter projection capability at the cost of durability. Unremarkable in its design, the ship essentially little more than a flying hangar and relies on escorts to keep enemies at bay.",,,
tahlan_Ingress,SHIP,"Intended as a successor to the Legion, the Ingress never quite took off with its heavier focus on its fighter complement. Regardless, ships of this type still enjoy a decent popularity with smaller navies for their broad mission profile and overall flexibility.",,,
tahlan_Yosei,SHIP,"A modification of the Tempest, the Yosei is a heavier frigate that sacrifices some mobility for additional firepower.",,,
tahlan_Skola,SHIP,"Small and fast, the Skola is a fast attack frigate built around a pair of prism coils, high-powered arc weapons that can fry ships and missiles alike. While these weapons lack range, the Skola's high mobility is more than capable of compensating for this weakness.",,,
tahlan_Haelequin,SHIP,"An aggressive frame combined with a temporal shell, the Haelequin is a frightening opponent to face. While the design's origins are unknown, it is assumed to be a discarded Tri-Tachyon prototype design that was later picked up and finished by an unknown Kassadari House.",,,
tahlan_Izanami,SHIP,"The final ship design created by Kassadari shipwrights before the collapse, the Izanami is the pinnacle of Kassadari engineering. Constructed around a fully-integrated 6th generation Temporal Circuit Grid it is the only ship of its kind as the majority of engineers involved in the project lost their life during the chaos that followed the collapse, leaving the Houses with only a partial understanding of the Izanami's inner workings.

Few of these ships were ever produced as its blueprints are likely lost to time and Kassadar's production capacity is only a faint shadow of its former self. The remaining operable vessels are a closely guarded treasure of the Houses, only deployed if of utmost necessity.

While outwardly only a light cruiser, the advanced temporal technology of the Izanami makes it punch far above its weight class, capable of taking on any other cruiser in the sector. Any captain capable of efficiently making use of its ability to almost stop time for a short duration will find the ship capable of unleashing terrifying barrages and dodging almost any kind of incoming fire. This power comes at a cost however, as the high-powered temporal field puts heavy strain on the ship's spaceframe, making it more susceptible to damage while active. Careless use of the system is a surefire way to an early grave.",,,
tahlan_Renki,SHIP,"A dedicated missile and support frigate, equipped with an active ECCM system that can provide ECCM benefits for nearby allies while active. Especially popular with missile-heavy fleets, the Renki is a workhorse frigate, that can also pack a punch by itself.",,,
,,,,,

#fighters,,,,,
tahlan_Acastus,SHIP,"A fast interceptor designed around a slightly modified volkite cannon. Quite effective against swarms of fighers and missiles, but lacks any punch against larger targets.",,,
tahlan_Caliver,SHIP,"Designed for the sole purpose of delivering a single Hekaton-class torpedo within strike distance, the Caliver is a relatively simple design by Kassadari standards. Of course, calling a fighter with integrated temporal circuit grid simple might be seen as a bit of an understatement by some.",,,

#Great House refits,,,,,
,,,,,
tahlan_monitor_gh,SHIP,"Heavily modified and overhauled by Kassadari engineers, this ship has been upgraded with the most advanced technologies of the Great Houses.

An oddity among ships, the Monitor is the result of the line of thought that “sometimes the best defense is indeed the best defense”. Features turret mounts angled to provide wide arcs and a unique “flux shunt” modification to its power systems specially constructed to relieve flux generated by shields. Indeed, the Monitor makes up for a lack of maneuverability and firepower with the ability to withstand prolonged bombardment from enemy ordnance.

Though its experimental nature is perhaps a sign of the innovation that eras of turmoil seem to inspire, whether the Monitor’s radical defensive focus is a boon or pitfall remains contentious. Several dramatic failures in convoy protection patrols were explained by Ko Combine PR representatives to be the fault of improper tactics employed by convoy commanders. Ko Combine maintains that when positioned correctly in a combat situation and supported by strikecraft - as the anvil and hammer, respectively - simulations demonstrate that the Monitor significantly enhances convoy survivability against the average pirate attack. Prominent critics remain.",,,
tahlan_legion_gh,SHIP,"Heavily modified and overhauled by Kassadari engineers, this ship has been upgraded with the most advanced technologies of the Great Houses.

Classified as a battlecarrier, the Legion mounts an impressive array of heavy weapons, hangar-space, and command-control sufficient to field four fighter wings. Later models were upgraded with nanoforges keyed to replacement of fightercraft, significantly increasing tooth-to-tail ratio on distant deployments.

After the legendary success of the Onslaught design it became clear that rebellious systems without ultraheavy industry were able to develop carrier-based strike-craft capable of countering the 'Old Man' of the Armada. Alongside new weapons - nimble anti-fighter missiles and rapid-tracking point defense cannon - the Strategic Council decided to deploy a carrier worthy of service alongside the Onslaught. Thus the Legion was designed to provide a platform for interceptors and strike-craft while standing on the line of battle. 

Proponents of the 'Cruiser School' criticized the Legion for insufficient specialization, maintaining that similar fighter volume can be fielded at less cost and greater flexibility if combat roles are separated into distinct ship hulls. These economic arguments do pale in the face of an incoming Legion engaging its burn drive to deliver crushing firepower at the key point of battle.",,,
tahlan_onslaught_gh,SHIP,"Heavily modified and overhauled by Kassadari engineers, this ship has been upgraded with the most advanced technologies of the Great Houses.

A venerable design, the Onslaught-class battleships were first created to serve the Domain Armada long ago, before the development of advanced strike weapons, modern energy weapons, and shield systems. 

When first launched from orbital dock, they must have surely dwarfed any other ship in existence and intimidated entire systems. Some even say that they were built to combat non-humans in a long forgotten war. Much later, Domain engineers made modifications to the blueprints to include a shield system, upgraded the FTL drives, and reduced the necessary crew complement through automation and iterative engineering. Even though more advanced blueprints are available, the Onslaught remains the easiest to manufacture due to the brutal simplicity of its systems. 

A ship designed without shields in mind, built to be able to withstand a heavy barrage of enemy fire and strike back while protecting its crew is much loved by its officers and crew. And strike back it can; the Onslaught's unmatched ballistic potential can devastate entire fleets in minutes, its only drawback a logistical dependency on ammunition. 

The Onslaught-class proudly serves as the backbone of the Hegemony Navy.",,,
tahlan_vendetta_gh,SHIP,"Heavily modified and overhauled by Kassadari engineers, this ship has been upgraded with the most advanced technologies of the Great Houses.

A dated but imposing battleship with a storied service history, the Vendetta is the Yang to the mighty Onslaught's Yin. While the Onslaught plays the part of blunt, chaotic sledgehammer, the Vendetta is a more precise “wedge” of a ship; steadier, more agile, and capable of concentrated bursts of fire with an ordnance package that favors capital-grade missile and torpedo weaponry.

Like its sibling battleship, the first production models of the Vendetta lacked shield generators, relying on their thick armor and arsenal of turreted weaponry for defense against attackers. Later versions of the hull were modernized and featured a mid-grade Omni shield, though unlike the Onslaught this would require a slight reduction in its armor package. Nonetheless, the Vendetta remains a highly durable ship. What it lacks in bezerker speed and raw firepower it makes up for with improved capacity for situational weapons systems and a potential tactical punch that an Onslaught could simply never match.",,,
tahlan_dominator_gh,SHIP,"Heavily modified and overhauled by Kassadari engineers, this ship has been upgraded with the most advanced technologies of the Great Houses.

Ponderous and menacing, the Dominator-class is one of the most widespread system defense cruisers in Hegemony space. 

While not the most technologically advanced hull, it relies on a plethora of ballistic hardpoints to accomplish its mission, which is more often than not defending orbital installations and vital points of intra-system trade routes. A poor shield emitter which is difficult to manage and thus, rarely engaged, gives way to an almost impregnable interlocking armor belt system making the Dominator safe from most weapons. Even strike craft cannot overcome the hail of projectiles that can be launched to intercept their payloads. This hull proves that tried and true military engineering is difficult to overcome by new ideas and technologies, especially when in the hands of tough, determined crews and experienced officers.

Dependable, durable, and a constant presence in home space around civilized worlds and outposts, the Dominator is perhaps most hated and feared by pirates and law-breaking corporate agents. ",,,
tahlan_enforcer_gh,SHIP,"Heavily modified and overhauled by Kassadari engineers, this ship has been upgraded with the most advanced technologies of the Great Houses.

The Enforcer-class ships commonly serve in system or convoy defense roles. The design features good armor and multiple ballistic hardpoints, while shield performance is somewhat underwhelming. 

The blueprints of the ship call for many components similar to those found in the Onslaught-class battleships, suggesting that the designs were created during a similar period of military expansion in the Domain. The Enforcer-class features similar no-nonsense weapon system design choices, tough bulkheads, and is well regarded by its crews.

Tough to beat in a destroyer to destroyer fight, the Enforcer rarely takes part in larger battles due to the common view that its low speed makes it a liability. Nonetheless, Hegemony order of battle doctrines mandate an attached Enforcer squadron as a screen for Onslaught-class battleships. The logistical ease with which shared components can be used by both ship types is exactly the type of detail that excites Hegemony Logisticarum bureaucrats.",,,
tahlan_Castigator_knight,SHIP,"Heavily modified and overhauled by Kassadari engineers, this ship has been upgraded with the most advanced technologies of the Great Houses.

Presumably a precursor design to the modern Eagle, the Castigator was, for its time, an overengineered assault cruiser that never made it into large-scale production due to numerous issues. Not only was it overpriced, but the downscaled TPCs in its forward prongs suffered from reliability issues with their magnetic containment systems.

tahlan_shiva,WEAPON,"A prototype pulse beam developed for the Yukikaze. Incredibly efficient and destructive for a beam weapon, it suffers from extreme beam dispersal at range, limiting it to extremely short range engagements.",Assault,,
tahlan_garuda,WEAPON,A prototype seeking pulse weapon developed for the Yukikaze. Fully integrated into the Yukikaze this odd weapon fires high energy plasma blasts that are then guided using EM-fields projected by the ship. The result is a unique energy weapon with missile-like properties.,Strike,,
tahlan_jigoku,WEAPON,"Replacing the Thermal Pulse Cannons, this beam weapon was adapted from salvaged stricture-type pulse beams, but remodulated to be equally efficient against shields and armour and fed by an oversized capacitor array capable of storing multiple charges, ready to be fired in quick succession.",Strike,,
tahlan_utpc,WEAPON,"A downscaled version of the Thermal Pulse Cannon, this unique weapon is notorious for its unreliability. While technically a defective design, many gunnery officers familiar with the weapon regard its tempramental nature as a feature rather than a flaw. Often discharging additional splinter bolts with each shot, the weapon's output will often exceed its intended firepower by vast amounts, albeit in a chaotic nature.",,,
tahlan_magaera,WEAPON,"In essence little more than a pair of twin-linked Gallant-type magnetic accelerator cannons with extended barrels, the Magaera improves on the range and firepower of its smaller sibling.",,,
tahlan_gallant,WEAPON,"Technically a fairly standard magnetic accelerator cannon, the Gallant is however a technological showpiece. Equipped with a miniaturized Temporal Circuit, the entire charging and firing mechanism is put under constant time acceleration, boosting the weapon's cycle rate compared to similar weapons.",,,

tahlan_styrix,WEAPON,"A weapon often described as relentless, this heavy magnetic accelerator cannon fires at a rate uncommon for weapons of its type. Designed to unleash a constant barrage of high-velocity impactor rounds to maintain heavy pressure. The impactor rounds are also loaded with a micro warhead that can cause additional damage if the round manages to pierce the outer layers of armor.",,,
tahlan_atrapos,WEAPON,"An unusual variant of magnetic accelerator cannon, firing a stream of superheated metal at extremely high speeds rather than a solid projectile. Highly effective at burning through armor, but struggles having any real effect on shields.",,,
tahlan_armiger,WEAPON,"Reliable and effective, the Armiger is a medium-caliber cannon that prioritizes projectile velocity and range over sheer firepower, making for a weapon that pairs well with high-velocity kinetic armaments.",,,
tahlan_prismcoil,WEAPON,"An integrated arc-discharge weapon, rapidly discharging bolts of energy to any enemies within its targeting cone. Effective against all targets, it can also function as a point-defense weapon.",,,
tahlan_astrix,WEAPON,"Designed as a brute-force weapon, the Numeon fires plasma shells with an antimatter core, equally destructive to all kinds of targets. Due to the vastly lower amount of antimatter per blast, it does not suffer from ammunition concerns like most antimatter-weaponry, but will still greatly stress most flux grids.",,,
