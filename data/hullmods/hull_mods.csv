Cooperative Protocols,tahlan_cooperative_protocols_yuki,,,,,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.scripts.hullmods.tahlan_CooperativeProtocolsYuki,"The Yukikaze and Korikaze hulls were specifically developed to be fielded in tandem. The Yukikaze features a powerful array of control devices and transmitters which allows it to provide detailed combat information for any nearby Korikaze-class vessels.

If any allied Korikaze-class ship is within %s SU, this ship counts its ECM rating as %s higher, has %s improved autofire accuracy, and gains %s additional top speed and acceleration.

If at least %s Korikaze-class ships are within this range, all bonuses are increased by %s.",Bonus when grouped with Korikazes,graphics/tahlan/hullmods/cooperative_protocols.png
