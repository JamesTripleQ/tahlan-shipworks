# Ships,,,,,

TSW_Yukikaze,SHIP,"Built by Tahlan Shipworks in cooperation with Sylphon, the Yukikaze is a technology showcase first and foremost. A high-performance assault cruiser equipped with a set of prototype weapons it packs an incredible punch for its size, but the prototype technologies used in its constructions make maintenance a nightmare.",,,
TSW_Korikaze,SHIP,"Designed as a support craft for the Yukikaze, these small drone frigates can be linked with the Yukikaze’s neural network to improve the performance of all linked vessels in combat and allow for complex attack maneuvers that require precise cooperation.",,,
TSW_Firemane,SHIP,"A modification of the Colossus born from a demand for a cheap platform for heavy weaponry. As the energy demand of these weapons surpasses the flux grid of the Colossus, the shield generator was removed and replaced with additional armour plating. While the Firemane’s combat performance is questionable, it is undeniably a cheaper heavy weapons platform than a Dominator.",,,
TSW_Yokai,SHIP,"Rebuilt from the salvaged wreckage of an Onslaught-class battleship, the Yokai was jury-rigged with Sylphon Nulltech by a former patrol commander gone rogue. Cannibalizing his old flagship, an Okarra-class cruiser, he and his crew upgraded the Onslaught with a nullspace conduit and armor polarizer and replaced most weapon mounts to support the modular weaponry of the Okarra. The result is as fearsome as one would expect and it would be safe to say that the sector can be glad it is one of a kind.",,,

# Weapons,,,,,

TSW_shiva,WEAPON,"A prototype pulse beam developed for the Yukikaze. Incredibly efficient and destructive for a beam weapon, it suffers from extreme beam dispersal at range, limiting it to extremely short range engagements.",Assault,,
TSW_garuda,WEAPON,A prototype seeking pulse weapon developed for the Yukikaze. Fully integrated into the Yukikaze this odd weapon fires high energy plasma blasts that are then guided using EM-fields projected by the ship. The result is a unique energy weapon with missile-like properties.,Strike,,
TSW_jigoku,WEAPON,"Replacing the Thermal Pulse Cannons, this beam weapon was adapted from salvaged stricture-type pulse beams, but remodulated to be equally efficient against shields and armour and fed by an oversized capacitor array capable of storing multiple charges, ready to be fired in quick succession.",Strike,,
