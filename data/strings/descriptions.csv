# Ships,,,,,
,,,,,
tahlan_Yukikaze,SHIP,"Built by Tahlan Shipworks in cooperation with Sylphon, the Yukikaze is a technology showcase first and foremost. A high-performance assault cruiser equipped with a set of prototype weapons it packs an incredible punch for its size, but the prototype technologies used in its constructions make maintenance a nightmare.",,,
tahlan_Korikaze,SHIP,"Designed as a support craft for the Yukikaze, these small drone frigates can be linked with the Yukikaze’s neural network to improve the performance of all linked vessels in combat and allow for complex attack maneuvers that require precise cooperation.",,,
tahlan_Firemane,SHIP,"A modification of the Colossus born from a demand for a cheap platform for heavy weaponry. As the energy demand of these weapons surpasses the flux grid of the Colossus, the shield generator was removed and replaced with additional armour plating. While the Firemane’s combat performance is questionable, it is undeniably a cheaper heavy weapons platform than a Dominator.",,,
tahlan_Yokai,SHIP,"Rebuilt from the salvaged wreckage of an Onslaught-class battleship, the Yokai was jury-rigged with Sylphon Nulltech by a former patrol commander gone rogue. Cannibalizing his old flagship, an Okarra-class cruiser, he and his crew upgraded the Onslaught with a nullspace conduit and armor polarizer and replaced most weapon mounts to support the modular weaponry of the Okarra. The result is as fearsome as one would expect and it would be safe to say that the sector can be glad it is one of a kind.",,,
tahlan_Castigator,SHIP,"Presumably a precursor design to the modern Eagle, the Castigator was, for its time, an overengineered assault cruiser that never made it into large-scale production due to numerous issues. Not only was it overpriced, but the downscaled TPCs in its forward prongs suffered from reliability issues with their magnetic containment systems. These issues aside, however, the performance of the Castigator is without question impressive. Combining heavy armor, numerous weapon mounts and adequate maneuverability in a heavy cruiser package designed to fight at the frontlines of any battle. Charging into combat with its visually spectacular Assault Burn, the Castigator is an awe-inspiring sight to behold and an enemy most would prefer to avoid facing head-on.",,,
tahlan_Bento,SHIP,"Lovingly called ""Lunchbox"" by many a captain for feeding their hungry ship drives, the Bento-class combat tanker is a sturdy little craft that can hold its own in battle. Often found in smaller flotillas that can't spare escorts for their logistics vessels or trade fleets that wish to be better defended against pirate attacks on long-haul routes, the Bento is a solid alternative to the ever-present Dram. While it obviously has to sacrifice fuel capacity, it is often a viable option to simply bring a second Bento.",,,
tahlan_Vale,SHIP,"""With holy furor he searches the land for any who would defy the will of his god, bringing carnage and death upon them. He is the holy warrior, guided by his unshakable faith.""",,,
tahlan_Exa_Pico,SHIP,"Rumours say the origin of this unusual craft was a bet between engineers of the Great Houses to turn the Kite into a fearsome combat vessel. True or not, the Exa Pico exists and is indeed a fearsome vessel in its own right. Probably taking inspiration from the Tempest, the Exa Pico heavily relies on its drones to provide the majority of its combat potential while the modified Kite itself serves primarily as control unit. Each drone is equipped with a powerful fractal laser, capable of engaging multiple targets at once and wiping outs whole swarms of missiles and strikecraft. 
Powerful as these capabilities are, however, the ship is still small and quite fragile while also being unable to deploy its drones from range, requiring close proximity to retain control of the advanced hardware.",,,
tahlan_Kodai,SHIP,"Based on the chassis of a reliable mining cruiser, the Kodai was overhauled from ground up for military use. Upgraded with with proper armor plating and modern hybrid weapon mounts, the only relic of its predecessor's role is the nose-mounted mining lance, as it proved to be surprisingly effective in combat. Originally designed to safely maneuver in and survey asteroid fields, the Kodai's chassis still comes equipped with state-of-the-art surveying equipment and a drive assembly that allows for swift movement. The focus on medium hardpoints is another artifact of its origins, once meant to hold a number of mining blasters, it now gives the Kodai menacing frontal firepower while its mobility mitigates risks of being flanked effectively.",,,
tahlan_Ambrosia,SHIP,"An unusual design, the Ambrosia was seemingly constructed around the salvaged hangar module of an unknown carrier design. While its exact origins are unknown, the hangar module is filled to the brim with state-of-the-art technology, including a recall system. Connecting the hangar module to a colorful mixture of salvaged ship parts has allowed it to operate as a standalone ship with surprising effectiveness, even though it is likely that whatever engineers are responsible for the design barely understood even half the technologies hidden inside the module.",,,
tahlan_Castella,SHIP,"An outdated carrier design, the Castella had mostly been replaced by the Legion in fleets of the Domain, but found itself popular with smaller system defense forces or independent fleets. Salvagers in particular took a liking to the antiquated design.",,,
tahlan_Castella_lp,SHIP,"Fanatics of the Luddic Path have made this ship their own, stripping out all unnecessary furnishing and transforming it into a haphazard vehicle of holy war.

Heavily modified by Pathers, this variant of the Castella sacrifices a considerable amount of its hangar space for two additional large hardpoints and an assault burn system which origins can only be guessed at. 

An outdated carrier design, the Castella had mostly been replaced by the Legion in fleets of the Domain, but found itself popular with smaller system defense forces or independent fleets. Salvagers in particular took a liking to the antiquated design.",,,
tahlan_Nessie,SHIP,"What madness drove scavengers to create this abomination of a phase ship remains unknown, but the crude amalgamation of two Gremlins and a Lasher has somehow come out to be a functional design. Presumably meant to emulate the Doom, this makeshift design falls short of that goal in just about every way imaginable. Its makeshift construction renders it remarkably fragile and noticably limits mobility potential. Truly, the only thing it has going for it is the rather surprising firepower it can muster.",,,
tahlan_Bungalow,SHIP,"An early competitor of the Mora, the Bungalow's designers favoured the idea of maximizing fighter projection capability at the cost of durability. Unremarkable in its design, the ship essentially little more than a flying hangar and relies on escorts to keep enemies at bay.",,,

# Weapons,,,,,
,,,,,
tahlan_shiva,WEAPON,"A prototype pulse beam developed for the Yukikaze. Incredibly efficient and destructive for a beam weapon, it suffers from extreme beam dispersal at range, limiting it to extremely short range engagements.",Assault,,
tahlan_garuda,WEAPON,A prototype seeking pulse weapon developed for the Yukikaze. Fully integrated into the Yukikaze this odd weapon fires high energy plasma blasts that are then guided using EM-fields projected by the ship. The result is a unique energy weapon with missile-like properties.,Strike,,
tahlan_jigoku,WEAPON,"Replacing the Thermal Pulse Cannons, this beam weapon was adapted from salvaged stricture-type pulse beams, but remodulated to be equally efficient against shields and armour and fed by an oversized capacitor array capable of storing multiple charges, ready to be fired in quick succession.",Strike,,
tahlan_utpc,WEAPON,"A downscaled version of the Thermal Pulse Cannon, this unique weapon is notorious for its unreliability. While technically a defective design, many gunnery officers familiar with the weapon regard its tempramental nature as a feature rather than a flaw. Often discharging additional splinter bolts with each shot, the weapon's output will often exceed its intended firepower by vast amounts, albeit in a chaotic nature.",,,
tahlan_magaera,WEAPON,A modern twin-linked magnetic accelerator cannon of Kassadari design. Featuring a multi-capacitor design allowing it to store charges for enhanced rate of fire at the start of combat.,,,
tahlan_porph,WEAPON,"The Kassadari answer to the common Heavy Mauler, this heavy cannon carries a heavy punch with its 3-round burst.",,,
tahlan_volkite,WEAPON,"The preferred point-defense solution of the Great Houses, this twin-barrel burst cannon fires highly effective voidburst rounds.",,,
tahlan_hekaton,WEAPON,"Designed as a more refined alternative to the more brutish torpedos commonly used in the sector, this Kassadari design carries a dual stage warhead, supplementing its explosive power with a plasma burst discharge.",,,
tahlan_styrix,WEAPON,"A weapon often described as relentless, this heavy magnetic accelerator cannon fires at a rate uncommon for weapons of its type. Designed to unleash a constant barrage of high-velocity impactor rounds to maintain heavy pressure. The impactor rounds are also loaded with a micro warhead that can cause additional damage if the round manages to pierce the outer layers of armor.",,,
tahlan_atrapos,WEAPON,"An unusual variant of magnetic accelerator cannon, firing a stream of superheated metal at extremely high speeds rather than a solid projectile. Highly effective at burning through armor, but struggles having any real effect on shields.",,,
