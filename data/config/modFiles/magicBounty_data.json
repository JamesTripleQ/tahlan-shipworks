The target offered to you is a former pirate warlord going by the name of Idris the Great, a grandstanding but crude example of a man.\nThe exact capabilities of your target's fleet seem to be unknown, but as rumor has it, the Legio is testing some new weaponry, god knows how they get their hands on that kind of tech, and Idris is involved in that program, so his ship is bound to be heavily armed.\nGo take that bastard out and make sure his fleet is crippled.",
